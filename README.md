[My Open API Cat Project](https://github.com/joc3lynn/jocelyn-ramirez-parada-open-api#)

Welcome to my project! This is an open API project, which displays data utilizing two different endpoints in the API. In the homepage is the first GET request where you can learn about cat breeds by selecting a breed from the drop down menu. When a breed is selected the following information about the breed is shown: image of the breed, temperament, brief description, and Wikipedia Link where you can read more in depth about the breed. There is a navigation bar that directs you the homepage on the left when you click on Cats and on the right there is a random cat image generator button that you can click which directs you to the second page. The second page generates random cat images by clicking the button you can access a new cat image each time. This is where the second GET request is used.
